"""Function Definition

@see: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions

The keyword def introduces a function definition. It must be followed by the function name and the
parenthesized list of formal parameters. The statements that form the body of the function start at
the next line, and must be indented.

    The first statement of the function body can optionally be a string literal; this string
    literal is the function’s documentation string, or docstring. There are tools which use
    docstrings to automatically produce online or printed documentation, or to let the user
    interactively browse through code; it’s good practice to include docstrings in code that you
    write, so make a habit of it.

    # local symbol tables of enclosing functions, then in the global symbol table, and finally in
